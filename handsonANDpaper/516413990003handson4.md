1. Question1  
    The cause of the key missing is originated inside the function pthread_create(&tha[i], NULL, put_thread, (void *) i) ( shown below ).  The argument pointer (void\*) i, which is used for array keys's index n in following-called function put_thread(void *xa), is overwritten when for-loop iteration increments. In order to prevent the argument i from being overwritten, add the lock in the function put like the code below.

    ```c
            void put(int key, int value){
                int b = key % NBUCKET;
                int i;
                assert(pthread_mutex_lock(&lock) == 0);
                // Loop up through the entries in the bucket to find an unused one:
                for (i = 0; i < NENTRY; i++) {
                    if (!table[b][i].inuse) {
                    table[b][i].key = key;
                    table[b][i].value = value;
                    table[b][i].inuse = 1;
                    assert(pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock) == 0);
                    return;
                    }
                }
                assert(pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock) == 0);
                assert(0);
            }
    ```


   

    
1. Question2  
    Add lock and unlock statements in put, and make sure there is no resource contention of valuable "table[][].inuse", which is originated from (void \*) i in pthread_create mentioned above question.
1. Question3  
    No, they have almost the same runnning times.  
    - one-threaded   
        completion time for put phase = 2.982153  
        completion time for get phase = 2.940046  
    - two-threaded  
        completion time for put phase = 3.996490  
        completion time for get phase = 3.733425

1. Question4  
    Most likely because of a number of nested loops. And The lock function's overheads affect speed.
1. Question5  
    Because The locks' overhead is affecting the speed.
1. Question6  
    Because readig from the same index of table, which is caused from race condition, doesn't cause any errors, wheras race condition DOES cause key missing because some keys would not be written.
1. Question7  
    Remove the resource contention existed in the pthread_create(&tha[i], NULL, put_thread, (void *) i). No race conditions on Ubuntu.  
    ```c 
            // Create nthread put threads
            long myid[nthread];
            for(i = 0; i < nthread; i++) {
                //assert(pthread_create(&tha[i], NULL, put_thread, (void *) i) == 0);
                myid[i]=i;
                assert(pthread_create(&tha[i], NULL, put_thread, &myid[i]) == 0);
            } 
    ```  
    And
    ```c
        static void *
        put_thread(void *xa)
        {
            //long n = (long) xa;
            long n = *((long*) xa);
            long i;
            int b = NKEYS/nthread;

            for (i = 0; i < b; i++) {
                put(keys[b*n + i], n);
            }
        }
    ```
